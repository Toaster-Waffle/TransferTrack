# TransferTrack
TransferTrack was our 1st place winning idea for the 2018 Mission College Hackathons It used PHP and html to create a website that helps prospective community college students get a head start on their academic careers.

This project currently only runs two machines, and one is mine. Check out this video to see how to run php files! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGh45mXF0zs
